# --- THIS BRANCH IS CLOSED ---

The `master` branch in this repository is a remnant from when this package was managed as tar-and-patch.
It is preserved for history only, is no longer maintained, and should receive no further commits.

Ongoing development now takes place on the `lsst-dev` branch, and that is probably where you want to be looking...
